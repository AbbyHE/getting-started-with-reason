# Getting Started With Reason

[Reason](http://facebook.github.io/reason) is a syntax and tooling ecosystem for OCaml. As time goes on we'll gradually polish it with more features, better build system story and package management. In the meantime, it's always good to understand what exactly happens under the hood.

This entire repository's commit history serves as a tutorial, starting from the first commit, with a simple shell file, and gradually building up to a productive workflow. Feel free to `git checkout` any commit, branch, fork, stash, etc.

To get started, clone this repo and `checkout` the first commit's message.

*Tip*: [GitUp](http://gitup.co) is your friend for viewing diffs in a reasonable way.
