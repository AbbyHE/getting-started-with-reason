# Getting Started With Reason

[Reason](http://facebook.github.io/reason) is a syntax and tooling ecosystem for OCaml. The OCaml's compilation and build system can get rather sophisticated; This repository serves as a tutorial that explains some of the intricacies. It's always nice to know what really happens under the hood!

We start with the most basic OCaml compiler commands and gradually build up to a productive workflow. Each step resides in its independent fully functional folder.

Feel free to as questions and contribute! P.S. we're on IRC freenode #reasonml and [Gitter facebook/reason](https://gitter.im/facebook/reason).
